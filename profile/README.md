# DigitalHistory@Lund

[DigitalHistory@Lund](https://projekt.ht.lu.se/digitalhistory) is an
interdepartmental research platform dedicated to  advancing digital history
research at [Lund University](https://lu.se). It works to integrate
existing digital history projects and supports the design and execution of new
projects. At the same time, the platform strives to build local digital
history capacity through skills training workshops, research seminars,
research engineer support, and by developing new courses in digital history.

We help researchers develop new cutting-edge historical projects, e.g. by
supporting the collection, cleaning, and analysis of data, and by preparing
grant applications.

[DigitalHistory@Lund](https://projekt.ht.lu.se/digitalhistory) is an
initiative by the [Section for Media History](https://kom.lu.se) in close
collaboration with [Lund Centre for the History of Knowledge (LUCK)
](https://www.newhistoryofknowledge.com) and
[Lund University Humanities Lab](https://www.humlab.lu.se).
The platform works with [Lund University Libraries](https://www.lub.lu.se/en/)
and other GLAM-partners in Sweden. It is funded by the Joint Faculties of
Humanities and Theology.
